### The AR Application for Identifying Emotions ###  
Objective: To offer users an option to identify a range of emotions at home, or in a comfortable space  
* The AR app allows for the selection of two modes: easy and advanced
* Once you select a mode, a random AR video will be displayed and the user must select from a scrollable bar which emotion they think it is.
  * The user has the option to restart, hide the options bar to see the video better, or open up a scenario box
* After questions have been answered, the app will let the user know how many they got correct and they then have the option to review their wrong answers, restart the mode, or go back to the main menu
  * Review mode takes user back to the AR mode and offers an explanation of the correct answer
